{
    "check_01_host_alive": "Ensure the target host is properly configured and accessible. If the host should not be reachable from external networks, implement proper firewall rules and network segmentation. For internal services, ensure proper access controls and monitoring are in place. Consider if the host needs to be publicly accessible.",
    "check_02_port_scan": "Close unnecessary open ports and services to reduce attack surface. Implement firewall rules (iptables, UFW, or cloud security groups) to restrict access to required ports only. Use port knocking or VPN access for administrative services. Regularly audit open ports and disable unused services. Document all necessary open ports.",
    "check_03_service_detect": "Secure all running network services: update to latest versions, disable unnecessary services, implement strong authentication, use encrypted protocols where possible. Configure services with minimal privileges, implement rate limiting, and monitor for unusual activity. Use service-specific security hardening guides.",
    "check_04_vuln_detect": "Immediately address any detected network service vulnerabilities: apply security patches, update software versions, implement workarounds for zero-day vulnerabilities, and consider disabling vulnerable services temporarily. Set up vulnerability monitoring, subscribe to security advisories, and implement a patch management process."
